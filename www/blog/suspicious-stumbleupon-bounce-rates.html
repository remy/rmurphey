I&#39;ve been watching my site using Google Analytics, and I&#39;ve noticed that visitors from StumbleUpon have a substantially lower bounce rate than, say, visitors from dzone. So I think, &quot;yay, StumbleUpon&quot; and start submitting anything interesting I write to there.
But in poking around in my Google Analytics a bit more, I&#39;ve also noticed that, on pages that I&#39;ve promoted through SU, I&#39;m seeing strange navigation patterns: for &quot;How I Learned CSS,&quot; 40% of visits to the page came from the page itself (and, as it logically follows, 40% of next pages were the page itself). The page was viewed a total of 4,700 times, but a little more than 2,800 of those pageviews were unique. Since bounce rate basically measures whether a new arrival went to another page before leaving the site, I&#39;m not sure it shouldn&#39;t count as a bounce if the second page the user visits is the same as the one they were already on.
I&#39;m not seeing this pattern with pages I don&#39;t promote on SU, which makes me curious. SU is clearly driving a ton of traffic to my site; it&#39;s just not clear that the traffic is actually resulting in the remarkably low bounce rate that Google Analytics shows. If I took out the 40% of people whose next page was the page they were already on, I&#39;m left with not even 1% of people who went to another, different page on the site before leaving -- and suddenly dzone is looking good again."><meta name="twitter:creator" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Suspicious StumbleUpon Bounce Rates?"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,400italic,300,800|Source+Code+Pro:400,700,300" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.9.1/styles/default.min.css"/><style>@media (max-width: 800px) {

<p>I did a Google search and didn&#39;t come up with much except <a href="http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/15/wwmd-reduce-bounce-rate/#comment-87245">this</a>, which discusses the importance of bounce rate, and <a href="http://www.seowife.com/stumbleupon-advertising/">this</a>, which suggests using StumbleUpon to reduce your bounce rate.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious whether anyone else is seeing this, and whether it&#39;s actually related to StumbleUpon, Google Analytics, or something else. If I had to guess, I&#39;d imagine that this is a result of people using the StumbleUpon toolbar (since it&#39;s not happening in all cases), and maybe the toolbar is pre-visiting the page on the user&#39;s behalf to make sure it still exists?</p>
